# **24 counter ( Based on the look and feel of the TV series)**

This project is a 24 timer counter based on the popular TV series.

It uses:
  > `React version 16 template (self made react template)`

  > No third party at all. Just vanilla JS for minor things.


# *Description*

The project contains no third party implementation. The counter doesn't have to be a 24 hour based count.

# *Things to note*

The length and thickness of the number building blocks can be modified in the `index.css` file under the ```root: {}``` variables.

Example:
  For a normal (small font) font looking size, the settings are :

  ![Small Settings Config](./src/images/smallFont/settingsConfig.png)

  The display result will look like:

  ![Small Display Result](./src/images/smallFont/displayResult.png)


  For a larger (large font) font looking size, the settings are :

  ![Large Settings Config](./src/images/largeFont/settingsConfig.png)

  The display result will look like:

  ![Large Display Result](./src/images/largeFont/displayResult.png)



To  know how to change the counter ranges, Read the comments in the TwentyFourCounter component inside the containers folder.
